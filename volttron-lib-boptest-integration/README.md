# boptest-integration

This python library is used for integrating boptest simulation into VOLTTRON platform. 

BOPTEST is designed to facilitate
the performance evaluation and benchmarking of building control strategies, which
contains these key components:

1. Run-Time Environment (RTE): Deployed with Docker and accessed with a RESTful HTTP API, use the RTE to set up tests,
   control building emulators, access data, and report KPIs.

1. Test Case Repository: A collection of ready-to-use building emulators representing a range of building types and HVAC
   systems.

1. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Reporting: A set of KPIs is calculated by the the RTE using data from the building
   emulator being controlled.

For more information, please visit [IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest).

# Prerequisites

* Python 3 (tested with Python3.10)
* Linux OS (tested with Ubuntu 22.04)

## Python

<details>
<summary>To install specific Python version (e.g., Python 3.10), we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a>.</summary>

```shell
# install pyenv
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv

# setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar)
export PATH="${HOME}/.pyenv/bin:${PATH}"
export PYENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# install Python 3.10
pyenv install 3.10

# make it available globally
pyenv global system 3.10
```

</details>

# Installation

The following recipe walks through the steps to install and run use case example.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment for installing library.

    ```shell
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```


1. Install the "volttron-boptest-integration" library.

   There are two options to install "volttron-boptest-integration". You can install this library using the version on PyPi or install
   it from the source code (`git clone` might be required.)

    ```shell
    # option 1: install from pypi
    pip install volttron-lib-boptest-integration
    
    # option 2: install from the source code (Note: `-e` option to use editable mode, useful for development.)
    pip install [-e] <path-to-the-source-code-root>/volttron-lib-boptest-integration/
    ```

# Basic Usage

In order to demonstrate the basic usage of volttron-lib-boptest-integration, we need to setup the boptest simulation
server.

### Setup the boptest simulation server locally.

(Please see more details about boptest quick-start
at [Quick-Start to Deploy a Test Case](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest#quick-start-to-deploy-a-test-case))

1. Download [IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest) repository to <boptest_repo>. For
   demo purpose, let boptest_repo be `/tmp/project1-boptest`.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest /tmp/project1-boptest
   ```

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

   (Optional) Verify with `docker-compose version` to verify the installation
   ```shell
   (env) kefei@ubuntu-22:~/sandbox/volttron-boptest$ docker-compose version
   docker-compose version 1.29.2, build unknown
   docker-py version: 5.0.3
   CPython version: 3.10.6
   OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022

   ```

1. Build and deploy a test case.

   The basic command to start a test case is by using `TESTCASE=<testcase_name> docker-compose up`.

   For demo purpose, we will build and deploy testcase1, for avialbe testcases please
   see [testcases/](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/tree/master/testcases)
   ```shell
   (env) kefei@ubuntu-22:~/sandbox/volttron-boptest$ TESTCASE=testcase1 docker-compose --file /tmp/project1-boptest/docker-compose.yml up
   Creating network "boptest-net" with the default driver
   Creating project1-boptest_boptest_1 ... done
   Attaching to project1-boptest_boptest_1
   boptest_1 | 07/13/2023 09:59:42 PM UTC root INFO Control step set successfully.
   boptest_1 | 07/13/2023 09:59:42 PM UTC root INFO Test simulation initialized successfully to 0.0s with warmup period of
   0.0s.
   boptest_1 | 07/13/2023 09:59:42 PM UTC root INFO Test case scenario was set successfully.
   ...
   boptest_1  |  * Debug mode: off
   boptest_1  | 07/13/2023 09:59:42 PM UTC werkzeug            INFO         * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```
   Or use detach mode
   ```shell
   (env) kefei@ubuntu-22:~/sandbox/volttron-boptest$ TESTCASE=testcase1 docker-compose --file /tmp/project1-boptest/docker-compose.yml up --detach 
   Starting project1-boptest_boptest_1 ... done
   ```

   Note: Use `docker-compose down` to shut down the service.

1. Run example usecases.
   
   There are several exmaple usecases available at [examples/](examples). In this demo,
   we will run [testcase1.py](examples/tescase1.py). 
   ```shell
   (env) kefei@ubuntu-22:~/sandbox/volttron-boptest$ python <examples-path>/testcase1.py
   INFO:root:=========== run_workflow
   INFO:root:
   TEST CASE INFORMATION
   ---------------------
   INFO:root:Name:                         testcase1
   ...
   INFO:root:======== run workflow completed.======
   ======= kpi {'cost_tot': 0.075149821513246, 'emis_tot': 0.2147137757521314, 'ener_tot': 1.073568878760657, 'idis_tot': 508.47225004790033, 'pdih_tot': None, 'pele_tot': None, 'pgas_tot': 0.09615811655434148, 'tdis_tot': 5.316029375566828, 'time_rat': 1.531114146269157e-05}
   ```

   Note: the example usecase must match the test case that is running. For example when TESTCASE=testcase1, we can
   run [testcase1.py](examples/testcase1.py) and [testcase1_scenario.py](examples/testcase1_scenario.py), but
   not [testcase2.py](examples/testcase2.py).
